                    Abstract: Distractions are common in the modern workplace with its noisy open-plan offices and
                    constant digital interruptions. I use an incentivized laboratory experiment to study the effects
                    of auditory and task-switching distractions on two important worker outcomes: performance and
                    mental well-being. I also elicit individual's willingness to pay to avoid distractions. Further,
                    I elicit people's attitudes towards working under distractions both in the lab and in a
                    representative Dutch survey panel. I obtain three main results. First, I find that while working
                    under distractions does not have a strong impact on performance in the lab, both types of distraction
                    are detrimental to individuals' self-reported mental well-being. Second, the heterogeneity in the
                    impact on mental well-being can be partially captured by simple survey questions on attitudes towards
                    working under distractions. These attitude questions are also strongly correlated with income and
                    job satisfaction in the survey data. Lastly, I find that individuals are willing to pay a positive
                    amount to avoid working under distractions on average and this willingness to pay is negatively
                    correlated with the change in mental well-being, but not in performance while working under distractions.

                <p class="paperDescription"> Many professional and educational settings require individuals to be willing and able to perform under time pressure.
                    We use a lab experiment to elicit preferences for working under time pressure in an incentivized way by eliciting the minimum additional payment
                    participants require to complete a cognitive task under various levels of time pressure versus completing it without pressure. We make three main
                    contributions. First, we document that participants are averse to working under time pressure on aggregate. Second, we show that there is substantial
                    heterogeneity in the degree of time pressure aversion across individuals and that these individual preferences can be partially captured by simple survey
                    questions. Third, we elicit these questions in a survey of bachelor students and show that time pressure preferences correlate with future career plans.
                    Our results indicate that individual differences in time pressure aversion could be an influential factor in determining labor market outcomes.
