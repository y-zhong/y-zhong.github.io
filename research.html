                    Abstract Individuals experience an increasing amount of distractions in educational and
                    professional settings. I use an incentivized lab experiment to study the effect of auditory
                    and task-switching distractions on performance and mental well-being and the preferences for
                    working under these two types of distractions. I obtain four main results. First, I find that
                    task-switching distraction reduces total earnings, but not auditory distraction. Second, I show
                    that the presence of either type of distraction is detrimental to individuals' self-reported mental
                    well-being and the heterogeneity in mental well-being can be partially captured by some of my simple
                    survey questions. Third, individuals are willing to pay more to avoid task-switching distraction than
                    auditory distraction. Finally, I find that women and men are equally good at handling distractions in
                    terms of both performance and mental well-being but women are willing to pay less to avoid both types
                    of distractions.

                <p class="paperDescription"> Many professional and educational settings require individuals to be willing and able to perform under time pressure.
                    We use a lab experiment to elicit preferences for working under time pressure in an incentivized way by eliciting the minimum additional payment
                    participants require to complete a cognitive task under various levels of time pressure versus completing it without pressure. We make three main
                    contributions. First, we document that participants are averse to working under time pressure on aggregate. Second, we show that there is substantial
                    heterogeneity in the degree of time pressure aversion across individuals and that these individual preferences can be partially captured by simple survey
                    questions. Third, we elicit these questions in a survey of bachelor students and show that time pressure preferences correlate with future career plans.
                    Our results indicate that individual differences in time pressure aversion could be an influential factor in determining labor market outcomes.
